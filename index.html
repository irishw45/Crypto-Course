<!-- LESSON CONTENT BELOW -->
<!-- FULL LESSONS 1–10 INSERTED HERE -->
<!-- START LESSON 1 -->
<div class="lesson" id="lesson1">
  <h2>Lesson 1: Intro to Trading & Markets</h2>
  <p class="explanation">Trading isn’t just about buying low and selling high — it’s about deeply understanding how markets behave and how participants respond to price movement in real time. Market structure is driven by human psychology: fear, greed, hesitation, and conviction. This lesson introduces how price is formed, the role of buyers and sellers, and how news, events, and even rumors can cause major shifts in sentiment. You'll also learn the distinction between different types of markets (such as spot, derivatives, and futures) and why liquidity, volatility, and volume shape trade opportunities. We’ll explore how trading is not gambling — it's calculated risk, where understanding the game improves your edge over time.</p>
  <div class="terms">
    <h3>Key Terms:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Market:</strong> A place or system where trading activity happens, like the stock or crypto market.</li>
      <li><strong>Exchange:</strong> A digital or physical platform where buyers and sellers interact to trade assets.</li>
      <li><strong>Volatility:</strong> How much and how quickly a price moves; high volatility means bigger price swings.</li>
      <li><strong>Trader:</strong> A person who actively buys and sells assets with the goal of making a profit.</li>
      <li><strong>Liquidity:</strong> How easy it is to buy or sell an asset without affecting its price too much.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>
<!-- START LESSON 2 -->
<div class="lesson" id="lesson2">
  <h2>Lesson 2: Understanding Crypto & Blockchain</h2>
  <p class="explanation">Before you start trading crypto, you must grasp what gives it any value at all. Cryptocurrency is more than digital money — it’s built on a technology called blockchain, which acts like an unchangeable public notebook, shared across thousands of computers. Every transaction is recorded, verified, and publicly accessible. This lesson breaks down what blockchain really is, how decentralization works, and how peer-to-peer networks create trust without needing banks. You'll learn about mining, nodes, consensus mechanisms, and how different blockchains (like Bitcoin vs Ethereum) serve different purposes. We’ll also explore the historical context of how crypto emerged as a response to financial system weaknesses, giving you a foundation to understand why it matters today.</p>
  <div class="terms">
    <h3>Key Terms:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Blockchain:</strong> A digital, public ledger that records transactions in a secure and permanent way.</li>
      <li><strong>Decentralization:</strong> The distribution of control away from a central authority, like a government or bank.</li>
      <li><strong>Token:</strong> A digital asset that represents value or access to a specific blockchain-based project.</li>
      <li><strong>Wallet:</strong> A software or device that stores your crypto and lets you send or receive it securely.</li>
      <li><strong>Ethereum:</strong> A blockchain platform known for smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps).</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>
<!-- START LESSON 3 -->
<div class="lesson" id="lesson3">
  <h2>Lesson 3: Technical Analysis 101</h2>
  <p class="explanation">Technical analysis is the art and science of reading price charts to interpret market sentiment. Instead of relying on financial statements or news, traders study historical price and volume behavior to predict future moves. You’ll learn to recognize patterns such as head and shoulders, wedges, triangles, and flags — formations that often precede breakout or breakdown moves. This lesson also introduces trendlines, support and resistance zones, and popular indicators like RSI (Relative Strength Index), MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence), and Bollinger Bands. We’ll also touch on the importance of multiple time frame analysis — how a pattern on a daily chart may behave differently than one on a 5-minute chart. By the end of this lesson, you’ll be able to understand why price 'respects' certain levels, and how traders use technical analysis to anticipate opportunities with an edge.</p>
  <div class="terms">
    <h3>Key Terms:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Candlestick:</strong> A visual representation of price movement within a set time period, showing open, high, low, and close prices.</li>
      <li><strong>Support/Resistance:</strong> Price levels where buyers or sellers tend to step in and reverse price movement.</li>
      <li><strong>Trend:</strong> The general direction in which price is moving: up (bullish), down (bearish), or sideways.</li>
      <li><strong>RSI:</strong> Relative Strength Index — an indicator that shows if something is overbought or oversold.</li>
      <li><strong>Moving Average:</strong> A smoothed line on a chart that tracks average price over a given time period.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>

<!-- START LESSON 4 -->
<div class="lesson" id="lesson4">
  <h2>Lesson 4: Fundamental Analysis for Crypto</h2>
  <p class="explanation">Fundamental analysis focuses on what gives a cryptocurrency long-term value. In traditional finance, fundamentals include earnings, debt, and economic indicators. In crypto, it revolves around a project's whitepaper, team, utility, tokenomics, community strength, and roadmap. You'll learn to analyze a project's goals, use cases, scalability, and governance model. This lesson explains how to dissect token supply metrics — such as total, circulating, and max supply — and how inflationary vs deflationary models influence price. We also explore how social signals like active developers, GitHub activity, and partnership announcements can be critical. The goal is to train you to evaluate whether a token is under- or overvalued based on its real potential, not hype.</p>
  <div class="terms">
    <h3>Key Terms:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Whitepaper:</strong> A document that explains a crypto project’s purpose, tech, and vision.</li>
      <li><strong>Tokenomics:</strong> The supply and demand design of a token, including issuance, allocation, and burn.</li>
      <li><strong>Utility:</strong> The actual function or use of a token in its network or product.</li>
      <li><strong>Supply:</strong> Total amount of tokens in circulation or available overall.</li>
      <li><strong>Market Cap:</strong> Price multiplied by circulating supply, used to estimate project size.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>

<!-- START LESSON 5 -->
<div class="lesson" id="lesson5">
  <h2>Lesson 5: Risk Management & Psychology</h2>
  <p class="explanation">Risk management is what separates amateurs from professionals in trading. This lesson explores how to systematically limit losses, preserve capital, and survive losing streaks — which are inevitable for every trader. You’ll learn the importance of risk-to-reward ratios, position sizing based on account equity, and how to place effective stop-loss orders. We’ll also dig into psychological traps like revenge trading, overconfidence after wins, and panic during drawdowns. Psychology plays a critical role: successful traders build habits and routines that minimize emotional interference. Through examples and frameworks, you’ll understand how to create a personal risk protocol and emotional response system that keep you consistent even during market stress.</p>
  <div class="terms">
    <h3>Key Terms:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Risk-to-Reward:</strong> How much you're risking compared to how much you aim to make.</li>
      <li><strong>Stop-Loss:</strong> A predefined exit to limit loss on a trade.</li>
      <li><strong>Position Size:</strong> The number of contracts or coins used in a trade relative to account size.</li>
      <li><strong>Discipline:</strong> Sticking to your rules no matter how you feel.</li>
      <li><strong>Fear/Greed:</strong> Powerful emotions that often lead to impulsive trading decisions.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>

<!-- START LESSON 6 -->
<div class="lesson" id="lesson6">
  <h2>Lesson 6: Trading Strategies & Backtesting</h2>
  <p class="explanation">Trading without a clearly defined strategy is like sailing in open waters with no compass or map. This lesson focuses on building structured, repeatable trading systems tailored to your personality and goals. You’ll explore popular strategies like trend-following, breakout, range-trading, and mean reversion, as well as how to adapt them for different timeframes. Then, we’ll dive into backtesting — the process of applying your strategy to historical data to measure consistency and reliability. You'll also learn how to track metrics like win rate, average risk/reward, max drawdown, and expectancy. A properly tested strategy gives you more than a plan — it gives you confidence to follow it even when emotions flare up or the market moves unpredictably.</p>
  <div class="terms">
    <h3>Key Terms:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Breakout:</strong> A move outside a defined range with increased volume and momentum.</li>
      <li><strong>Trend-Following:</strong> A strategy that seeks to profit by riding upward or downward trends.</li>
      <li><strong>Backtest:</strong> Using past data to simulate how a strategy would have performed.</li>
      <li><strong>Strategy:</strong> A consistent set of rules used to enter and exit trades.</li>
      <li><strong>Edge:</strong> A statistical advantage that improves a trader’s chances of success.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>

<!-- START LESSON 7 -->
<div class="lesson" id="lesson7">
  <h2>Lesson 7: Order Types & Market Mechanics</h2>
  <p class="explanation">Placing an order is where trading execution begins. Whether you're trying to enter a position immediately or at a specified price, choosing the right order type is key. This lesson introduces market orders (which fill instantly), limit orders (which wait for a better price), and stop orders (which trigger only after certain conditions are met). We’ll also explore how exchanges route orders, how liquidity providers affect fill prices, and what slippage means for high-speed markets. Understanding how spreads form and how to interpret the depth of the order book gives you insight into real-time supply and demand. We’ll finish by showing how different order types behave in volatile vs low-volume markets, helping you avoid costly execution mistakes.</p>
  <div class="terms">
    <h3>Key Terms:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Market Order:</strong> An order that fills immediately at the current price.</li>
      <li><strong>Limit Order:</strong> An order to buy or sell only at a specified price or better.</li>
      <li><strong>Stop Order:</strong> An order that becomes active when a specific price is hit.</li>
      <li><strong>Slippage:</strong> The difference between expected and actual fill price.</li>
      <li><strong>Order Book:</strong> A real-time list of buy and sell orders on an exchange.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>

<!-- START LESSON 8 -->
<div class="lesson" id="lesson8">
  <h2>Lesson 8: Leverage & Margin</h2>
  <p class="explanation">Leverage allows you to open larger trades than your capital would normally permit, but this financial power comes with serious risk. In this lesson, you’ll learn how leverage multiplies both gains and losses, and how margin requirements vary across exchanges. We’ll walk through what initial margin, maintenance margin, and liquidation mean, and how to calculate your liquidation price. We'll also discuss isolated vs cross margin settings, the role of funding fees, and what happens when your account value dips below a threshold. Real-world examples will illustrate how even a small market move can wipe out overleveraged traders. Proper use of leverage requires discipline and planning — not chasing quick wins.</p>
  <div class="terms">
    <h3>Key Terms:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Leverage:</strong> Using borrowed funds to increase trade size.</li>
      <li><strong>Margin:</strong> Capital set aside as collateral for leveraged positions.</li>
      <li><strong>Liquidation:</strong> Forced closure of a position due to insufficient margin.</li>
      <li><strong>Collateral:</strong> Assets pledged to secure a loan or position.</li>
      <li><strong>Borrowing:</strong> Using another party’s capital to execute trades.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>

<!-- START LESSON 9 -->
<div class="lesson" id="lesson9">
  <h2>Lesson 9: Security & Avoiding Scams</h2>
  <p class="explanation">In crypto, you are your own bank — which means the responsibility for your security falls entirely on you. This lesson teaches how to protect your assets against scams, hacks, and personal error. You'll learn how phishing attacks work, why it's dangerous to reuse passwords, and what seed phrases really are. We explore the differences between hot and cold wallets, how hardware wallets like Ledger or Trezor keep funds offline, and how 2FA (two-factor authentication) adds critical protection. Real-world stories of rug pulls and fake websites show how even experienced users can be tricked. Security isn't optional in crypto — it's the foundation of survival.</p>
  <div class="terms">
    <h3>Key Terms:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Seed Phrase:</strong> A string of words used to recover your crypto wallet. Keep it secret.</li>
      <li><strong>Phishing:</strong> A scam that tricks users into revealing sensitive info.</li>
      <li><strong>Rug Pull:</strong> A type of scam where developers abandon a project after taking investors' money.</li>
      <li><strong>2FA:</strong> Two-factor authentication for stronger account protection.</li>
      <li><strong>Cold Wallet:</strong> An offline wallet not connected to the internet for safer crypto storage.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>

<!-- START LESSON 10 -->
<div class="lesson" id="lesson10">
  <h2>Lesson 10: Building a Trading Plan</h2>
  <p class="explanation">A trading plan is your personal blueprint — a structured framework that outlines exactly how you approach the market. It includes your strategies, risk management rules, entry and exit criteria, timeframes, and even your mindset goals. This lesson shows how to write a plan that’s detailed but adaptable. You’ll learn how to create checklists before placing a trade, how to log and review each session, and how to revise your plan when needed. A strong plan turns chaos into order and emotions into process. It helps you focus not on outcomes but on execution — and over time, this discipline is what builds consistency and confidence.</p>
  <div class="terms">
    <h3>Key Terms:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Trading Plan:</strong> A personalized guide that defines rules, risk, and strategy.</li>
      <li><strong>Journal:</strong> A log of trades, thoughts, and results used to learn from experience.</li>
      <li><strong>Accountability:</strong> Taking ownership of outcomes and following through on process.</li>
      <li><strong>Goals:</strong> Clear objectives to keep focus and measure growth.</li>
      <li><strong>Consistency:</strong> The ability to execute reliably and avoid randomness in behavior.</li>
    </ul>
