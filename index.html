      <h2>Lesson 1: Intro to Trading & Markets</h2>
      <p class="explanation">Trading is the practice of exchanging one asset for another, usually with the goal of making a profit from price changes. Markets are simply where this activity happens. Some people trade stocks, others trade crypto or commodities. The important thing is understanding that prices are driven by what people are willing to pay. Whether you're trading Bitcoin or Apple shares, you're part of a constantly moving ecosystem of buyers and sellers. The goal isn't to be right every time — it's to build an edge over time using discipline and smart decision-making.</p>
      <div class="terms">
        <h3>Key Terms:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Market:</strong> A place or system where trading activity happens, like the stock or crypto market.</li>
          <li><strong>Exchange:</strong> A digital or physical platform where buyers and sellers interact to trade assets.</li>
          <li><strong>Volatility:</strong> How much and how quickly a price moves; high volatility means bigger price swings.</li>
          <li><strong>Trader:</strong> A person who actively buys and sells assets with the goal of making a profit.</li>
          <li><strong>Liquidity:</strong> How easy it is to buy or sell an asset without affecting its price too much.</li>
        </ul>

      <h2>Lesson 2: Understanding Crypto & Blockchain</h2>
      <p class="explanation">At its core, cryptocurrency is just digital money — but it's powered by something much bigger: blockchain. A blockchain is a public ledger, meaning everyone can see the transactions and no one can change them. That’s where the trust comes from. Crypto is decentralized, which means no one person or government controls it. That gives it power — and volatility. Once you understand what makes crypto work under the hood, you stop just guessing at price movements and start thinking like someone who understands the network, the incentives, and the real value of these assets.</p>

        <h3>Key Terms:</h3>

          <li><strong>Token:</strong> A digital asset that represents value or access to a specific blockchain-based project.</li>
          <li><strong>Wallet:</strong> A software or device that stores your crypto and lets you send or receive it securely.</li>
          <li><strong>Ethereum:</strong> A blockchain platform known for smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps).</li>
