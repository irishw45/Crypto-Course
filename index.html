      <h2>Lesson 1: Intro to Trading & Markets</h2>
      <p class="explanation">Trading is the practice of exchanging one asset for another, usually with the goal of making a profit from price changes. Markets are simply where this activity happens. Some people trade stocks, others trade crypto or commodities. The important thing is understanding that prices are driven by what people are willing to pay. Whether you're trading Bitcoin or Apple shares, you're part of a constantly moving ecosystem of buyers and sellers. The goal isn't to be right every time — it's to build an edge over time using discipline and smart decision-making.</p>

      <h2>Lesson 2: Understanding Crypto & Blockchain</h2>
      <p class="explanation">At its core, cryptocurrency is just digital money — but it's powered by something much bigger: blockchain. A blockchain is a public ledger, meaning everyone can see the transactions and no one can change them. That’s where the trust comes from. Crypto is decentralized, which means no one person or government controls it. That gives it power — and volatility. Once you understand what makes crypto work under the hood, you stop just guessing at price movements and start thinking like someone who understands the network, the incentives, and the real value of these assets.</p>

      <h2>Lesson 3: Technical Analysis 101</h2>
      <p class="explanation">Technical analysis is the art of reading charts. Instead of looking at a company’s balance sheet or a crypto project’s whitepaper, traders focus on price and volume data. They study past market behavior to anticipate future price movement. It’s less about prediction and more about understanding probability. Patterns like head and shoulders, flags, or double tops tell stories of supply and demand. Indicators like RSI and MACD are tools, not rules — they help you spot momentum or exhaustion. The goal isn’t to overcomplicate things; it’s to train your eyes to recognize setups that tilt odds in your favor.</p>
