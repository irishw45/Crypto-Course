  <h2>Lesson 4: Fundamental Analysis for Crypto</h2>
  <p class="explanation">Fundamental analysis is about understanding the value behind an asset. In crypto, that means reading whitepapers, examining tokenomics, and evaluating the team and community. You want to know what a project does, how it works, and why it might succeed. The more clarity a project has on its utility, use case, and adoption potential, the stronger its fundamentals. Smart investors don’t just ask 'what’s the price' — they ask 'what’s the value?'</p>
  <div class="terms">
    <h3>Key Terms:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Whitepaper:</strong> A document that explains a crypto project’s purpose, tech, and vision.</li>
      <li><strong>Tokenomics:</strong> The supply and demand design of a token, including issuance, allocation, and burn.</li>

  <h2>Lesson 5: Risk Management & Psychology</h2>
  <p class="explanation">This lesson teaches you how to protect your capital and yourself. It’s not just about technical skill — it’s emotional control. You must know how much to risk per trade, how to use stop-losses, and how to avoid revenge trading. Winning traders aren't the most talented — they’re the most disciplined. Build a system and follow it even when emotions flare up. Your biggest enemy is your own psychology.</p>
  <div class="terms">

  <h2>Lesson 6: Trading Strategies & Backtesting</h2>
  <p class="explanation">Trading without a strategy is like sailing without a compass. In this lesson, you’ll learn how to develop a rule-based trading strategy and test it before risking real money. Strategies might include trend-following, mean reversion, breakout trading, and more. Backtesting involves applying your rules to historical price data to see how it would’ve performed. While past results don't guarantee future success, they help build confidence and clarity in execution.</p>
  <div class="terms">

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Breakout:</strong> A move outside a defined range with increased volume and momentum.</li>

      <li><strong>Strategy:</strong> A consistent set of rules used to enter and exit trades.</li>
      <li><strong>Edge:</strong> A statistical advantage that improves a trader’s chances of success.</li>
    </ul>

<div class="lesson" id="lesson7">
  <h2>Lesson 7: Order Types & Market Mechanics</h2>
  <p class="explanation">Placing an order is the core mechanic of executing trades. Whether you use a market order to get filled quickly or a limit order to control price, knowing when and how to use each type is crucial. Stop orders let you automate risk management. Slippage and spread can hurt profitability if you’re unaware of how fast or illiquid a market is. Understanding how exchanges match trades helps you avoid poor fills and bad habits.</p>
  <div class="terms">
    <h3>Key Terms:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Market Order:</strong> An order that fills immediately at the current price.</li>
      <li><strong>Limit Order:</strong> An order to buy or sell only at a specified price or better.</li>
      <li><strong>Stop Order:</strong> An order that becomes active when a specific price is hit.</li>
      <li><strong>Slippage:</strong> The difference between expected and actual fill price.</li>
      <li><strong>Order Book:</strong> A real-time list of buy and sell orders on an exchange.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

<div class="lesson" id="lesson8">
  <h2>Lesson 8: Leverage & Margin</h2>
  <p class="explanation">Leverage gives traders the ability to control large positions with less capital, but it magnifies both profits and losses. Margin is the capital required to open and maintain these positions. If the market moves against you too far, you can be liquidated. Use leverage with great caution, and always understand how margin requirements and liquidation prices work.</p>
  <div class="terms">
    <h3>Key Terms:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Leverage:</strong> Using borrowed funds to increase trade size.</li>
      <li><strong>Margin:</strong> Capital set aside as collateral for leveraged positions.</li>
      <li><strong>Liquidation:</strong> Forced closure of a position due to insufficient margin.</li>
      <li><strong>Collateral:</strong> Assets pledged to secure a loan or position.</li>
      <li><strong>Borrowing:</strong> Using another party’s capital to execute trades.</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>Lesson 9: Security & Avoiding Scams</h2>
  <p class="explanation">The crypto space can be unforgiving when it comes to mistakes. You are your own bank, which means you’re responsible for your security. Always use 2FA, never share your seed phrase, and be cautious of phishing websites and rug pulls. Use cold wallets for long-term storage and verify everything twice. A moment of carelessness can lead to a total loss of funds.</p>
  <div class="terms">
    <h3>Key Terms:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Seed Phrase:</strong> A string of words used to recover your crypto wallet. Keep it secret.</li>
      <li><strong>Phishing:</strong> A scam that tricks users into revealing sensitive info.</li>
      <li><strong>Rug Pull:</strong> A type of scam where developers abandon a project after taking investors' money.</li>
      <li><strong>2FA:</strong> Two-factor authentication for stronger account protection.</li>
      <li><strong>Cold Wallet:</strong> An offline wallet not connected to the internet for safer crypto storage.</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>Lesson 10: Building a Trading Plan</h2>
  <p class="explanation">A trading plan keeps you grounded. It defines your strategy, entry/exit rules, position sizing, and how you handle different scenarios. It also includes journaling and review — critical parts of growing. The more specific your plan, the easier it is to follow with discipline. Consistency comes not from being right all the time, but from executing your plan correctly over time.</p>
  <div class="terms">
    <h3>Key Terms:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Trading Plan:</strong> A personalized guide that defines rules, risk, and strategy.</li>
      <li><strong>Journal:</strong> A log of trades, thoughts, and results used to learn from experience.</li>
      <li><strong>Accountability:</strong> Taking ownership of outcomes and following through on process.</li>
      <li><strong>Goals:</strong> Clear objectives to keep focus and measure growth.</li>
      <li><strong>Consistency:</strong> The ability to execute reliably and avoid randomness in behavior.</li>
